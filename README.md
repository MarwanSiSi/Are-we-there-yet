## Motivation

The "Are We There Yet?" project aims to create a virtual trip planner that simplifies the process of planning and booking trips. By leveraging modern technologies such as MongoDB, JWT, Cloudinary, and Stripe, this project provides a seamless and secure experience for users to manage their travel plans. The motivation behind this project is to offer a comprehensive solution that addresses common pain points in trip planning, such as booking management, payment processing, and document handling, all while ensuring user data security and ease of use.

## Build Status

### Deployment

This project is deployed on Render.
You can access it at [Are We There Yet](https://are-we-there-yet-mirror-1.onrender.com/).

Backend Deployment: [Backend](https://are-we-there-yet-mirror.onrender.com/api)
Frontend Deployment: [Frontend](https://are-we-there-yet-mirror-1.onrender.com/)

### Possible Deployment Issues and Solutions

- **MongoDB Connection Error:**

  - If you encounter a MongoDB connection error, ensure that your MongoDB connection URI is correctly configured in the `.env` file.
  - MongoDB does not work on Orange network, so you may need to use a different network.

- **Cloudinary Configuration Error:**

  - If you face issues with Cloudinary configuration, verify that your Cloudinary URL is correctly set in the `.env` file.
  - Ensure that your Cloudinary account is active and has the necessary permissions to upload and manage files.

- **Testing Issues**

  - Incomplete Test Coverage: If you encounter issues with test coverage, ensure that all critical components and functions are tested.
  - CI/CD requires constant updates to the test suite to ensure that new features and changes are adequately tested.

- **Missing Data On Flight or Hotel Pages**

  - API limits may cause missing data on flight or hotel pages. Ensure that you have the necessary API keys and permissions to access the required data. Upgrading the API plan may help resolve this issue.

- **Deployment Issues**

  - If you face deployment issues, check the deployment logs for error messages and warnings. Common deployment issues include missing dependencies, incorrect environment variables, and network connectivity problems.

  - The Free Tier of Render has limitations on the number of services and resources available.

## Code Examples

### Authentication Middleware

Below is an example of an authentication middleware using Express and JWT. This middleware verifies the JWT token and attaches the user payload to the request object. It also includes a function to allow certain paths to be accessed without authentication.

```typescript
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import { logger } from './logger.middleware';
import { ResponseStatusCodes } from '../types/ResponseStatusCodes.types';

interface UserPayload {
  userId: string;
  accountType: string;
}

declare global {
  namespace Express {
    interface Request {
      user: UserPayload;
    }
  }
}

const authenticateToken = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const token = req.header('Authorization')?.split(' ')[1];

  if (!token) {
    logger.error('Access Denied');
    res.status(ResponseStatusCodes.UNAUTHORIZED).send('Access Denied');
    return;
  }

  if (req.header('Authorization')?.split(' ')[0] !== 'Bearer') {
    logger.error('Invalid Token');
    res.status(ResponseStatusCodes.UNAUTHORIZED).send('Invalid Token');
    return;
  }

  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.TOKEN_SECRET as string) as UserPayload;
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    logger.error('Expired Token:', err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Unknown error');
    res.status(ResponseStatusCodes.FORBIDDEN).send('Expired Token');
  }
};

const openPaths = [
  { path: '/api/auth/register', methods: ['POST'] },
  { path: '/api/auth/login', methods: ['POST'] },
  { path: '/api/itineraries/get', methods: ['GET'] },
  { path: '/api/museums/getall', methods: ['GET'] },
  { path: '/api/activities', methods: ['GET'] },
  { path: '/api/attachments', methods: ['POST'] },
  { path: '/api/termsAndConditions', methods: ['GET'] },
  { path: '/api/tags', methods: ['GET'] },
  { path: '/api/categories', methods: ['GET'] },
  { path: '/api/users/forgotPassword', methods: ['POST'] },
  { path: '/api/users/verifyOTP', methods: ['POST'] },
];

const authenticateUnlessOpen = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const isOpenPath = openPaths.some((route) => route.path === req.path && route.methods.includes(req.method));

  if (isOpenPath) {
    return next();
  }

  return authenticateToken(req, res, next);
};

export { authenticateToken, authenticateUnlessOpen };
```

### Activity Controller

```typescript
import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import activityRepo from '../database/repositories/activity.repo';

const createActivity = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const activity = req.body;
    activity.created_by = req.user.userId;
    const newActivity = await activityRepo.createActivity(activity);
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Activity created successfully', data: { activityId: newActivity._id } });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ message: error.message, data: [] });
  }
};

export { createActivity };
```

### React Component

Below is an example of a React component that uses the Radix UI library to create a custom select dropdown with a trigger component.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as SelectPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-select';
import { Check, ChevronDown, ChevronUp } from 'lucide-react';

const Select = SelectPrimitive.Root;

const SelectTrigger = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof SelectPrimitive.Trigger>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof SelectPrimitive.Trigger>
>(({ className, children, ...props }, ref) => (
  <SelectPrimitive.Trigger
    ref={ref}
    className={`flex h-full w-full items-center justify-between rounded-md bg-background p-3 placeholder:text-muted-foreground focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-accent-gold disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50 ${className}`}
    {...props}
  >
    {children}
    <SelectPrimitive.Icon asChild>
      <ChevronDown className="h-4 w-4 opacity-50" />
    </SelectPrimitive.Icon>
  </SelectPrimitive.Trigger>
));
SelectTrigger.displayName = SelectPrimitive.Trigger.displayName;

export { Select, SelectTrigger };
```

### Axios Instance

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';
import { NavigateFunction } from 'react-router';

const axiosInstance = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_BACK_BASE_URL,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

axiosInstance.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    config.headers = config.headers || {};
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    if (token) {
      config.headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
    }
    const currency = localStorage.getItem('currency') || 'EGP';
    config.headers['Currency'] = currency;
    return config;
  },
  (error) => {
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);

export const setupInterceptors = (navigate: NavigateFunction) => {
  // Response Interceptor
  axiosInstance.interceptors.response.use(
    (response) => response,
    (error) => {
      if (error.response && [401, 403].includes(error.response.status)) {
        localStorage.removeItem('token');
        navigate('/register');
      }
      return Promise.reject(error);
    }
  );
};

export default axiosInstance;
```
